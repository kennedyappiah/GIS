# GIS
My GIS projects portfolio showcasing geospatial analysis, mapping, and automation using Python and SQL.
i performed a supervised classification on a portion of ghana specifically around the eastern, greater accra and volta regions of Ghana.
this is to identify land use and land cover changes in the regions to acertain how urbanization is affecting our vegetative cover and farmlands.
i used landsat 8 imagery from 2021 and performed the analysis using SCP in QGIS
It was identified that forest areas were being converted to buildings and farmlands. i also identified that there were buildings ongoing along the river banks which if not regulated can lead to floods in the future.
